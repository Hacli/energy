\subsection{Results for wholesale}
\label{subsec:r_wholesale}
For the peak-hours 12-15 on business days wholesale of electricity is estimated to decrease with 5.0 pct. when the spot price doubles, other things equal (Table \ref{tab:ws_preferred}).

\subsection{Results for households and small companies}
For the grid company Radius operating in the Copenhagen metropolitan area flex-settled customers (households and small companies) are charged a Time-of-Use (TOU) tariff of 0.835 DKK (0.112 EUR) for the hours 17-19 from October-March as opposed to 0.3236 DKK otherwise (0.043 EUR). The estimated effect of this tariff is found to be a decrease in electricity use of 1.9 pct. However, on business days the smaller effect of 1.4 pct. is only statistically significant at the 10\% level while the decrease is 4.4 pct. on non-business days. Table \ref{tab:hh_17-19} shows pooled 2SLS estimates of electricity consumption for households and small companies in Radius for the hours 17, 18, and 19. The estimation results also show a small elasticity for the hourly spot price which is instrumented for by wind power prognosis for DK2 and DK1. This is despite only a few number of the consumers pay the spot market price rather than a quarterly average.

\subsection{Possible extensions}
\label{subsec:r_extensions}
One possible extension could be to include grid-specific effects other than the random constant term. This is feasible yet cumbersome. The motivation being that one can expect a exists great variation between companies in terms of size, distribution of customers (residential and commercial), industry-intensity. Both at a certain point in time and regarding the time patterns. In our estimation results the time trend does not carry much explanatory power given the other controls, however, this can be due to effects of different direction for different grids covering different areas of the country.
\medskip\\
A very tractable extension would be to use micro data which would allow to control for compositional changes in the presence of heterogeneous consumers.
