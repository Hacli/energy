% Consequences and implications for the public policy from different expected results.
\subsection{Results for wholesale}
\label{subsec:r_wholesale}
For the peak-hours 12-15 on business days wholesale of electricity is estimated to decrease with 5.0 pct. when the spot price doubles, other things equal (Table \ref{tab:ws_preferred}).

\subsection{Results for households and small companies}
For the grid company Radius operating in the Copenhagen metropolitan area flex-settled customers (households and small companies) are charged a Time-of-Use (TOU) tariff of 0.835 DKK (0.112 EUR) for the hours 17-19 from October-March as opposed to 0.3236 DKK otherwise (0.043 EUR). The estimated effect of this tariff is found to be a decrease in electricity use of 1.9 pct. However, on business days the smaller effect of 1.4 pct. is only statistically significant at the 10\% level while the decrease is 4.4 pct. on non-business days. Table \ref{tab:hh_17-19} shows pooled 2SLS estimates of electricity consumption for households and small companies in Radius for the hours 17, 18, and 19.
